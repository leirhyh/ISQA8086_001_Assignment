## D3—Data Visualization approach and case study on the global surface temperature change

## data preparation
The data was download from the following [link](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) and processed with following [Rscript](https://github.com/leirhyh/ISQA8086_001_Assignment/blob/master/researchPaperdataPrepared.R).
## Case Study 1
[Global surface seasonal means temperature anomalies(°C) from 1880 to 2016](https://github.com/leirhyh/ISQA8086_001_Assignment/tree/master/Seasonal). The source code and data stored in [link] (http://bl.ocks.org/asielen/44ffca2877d0132572cb).
## Case Study 2
[Global surface monthly means temperature anomalies(°C) from 1880 to 2016](https://github.com/leirhyh/ISQA8086_001_Assignment/tree/master/monthdata). The source code and data stored in link.  Code modified from the following [link](http://blockbuilder.org/pmariac/9f350f74ae2e7dcbc8c02e940a5777dc)
## Case Study 3
